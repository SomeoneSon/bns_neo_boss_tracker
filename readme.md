# MutaFinder - Blade and Soul Field Boss Detection

## Overview
MutaFinder is an automated detection tool designed to locate and track field bosses in the MMORPG Blade and Soul NEO. This project facilitates information exchange between players across different channels, creating a collaborative network. When a player discovers a boss on their channel, the information is automatically shared with other MutaFinder users. Channels without active players won't provide any data, ensuring information remains current and relevant to active gameplay areas.
